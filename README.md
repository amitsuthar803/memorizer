## CSS Structure

### Custom Properties

The CSS uses custom properties (CSS variables) for colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements to maintain consistency and ease of customization.

### Typography

The app uses the Poppins font family and defines various font sizes, line heights, font weights, and letter spacings for different text elements such as display, headline, title, body, and label texts.

### Spacing and Radius

The app includes a set of spacing variables for consistent padding and margins, and border-radius variables for rounded corners.

### Transitions

Smooth transitions are achieved using custom properties for transition durations and easing functions.
